The humming continues.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"There it is again, the end. I started a forest fire. It's too loud!\"<br><br>\n\t\n\tThe next pages have undecipherable scribbles and diagrams."],

Our group of men have discovered several different types of treasure, some even from slaying the ravenous indigenous creatures that seem to roam these islands and caves. But we cannot seem to leave, we need more. The island demands it.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\tThe next pages seem to be ripped out and missing.<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"We have failed. Many have perished. We are missing the final piece. I do not think we can make it much further. We seem to have angered nature itself.\""],

Cross referencing other resources and even some older journals we have found references to deities, spirits, and even Gods. Most likely worshiped by the heathens that used to inhabit these lands. They seem connected to these islands somehow.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"The three names seem to be mentioned again and again, Wry, Da, and Aw.\""],

Not only that, but civilizations, skeletal remains, abandoned houses, and much evidence to support some type of apocalyptic scenario.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"Not only that, but it seems to happen again and again; the evidence all points to different ages and different points in time. It appears as though no people are able to survive and thrive in these lands, like some force is forbidding human progress.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"These ravenous, unabating creatures are not helping matters, that's for sure.\""],

The best casting method I have found using resources around me was sand casting.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"The primary ingredient for creating a sand cast is greensand, a mixture of clay flakes and refined sand. This allows for the malleability of creating the shape of tool and weapon heads, or even forming the ingots in which to work from.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"Next, we place the greensand in a flask, crafted with wood, finishing the build of the sand cast flask. We then set the shape, place down some talc powder so the finished produce can be lifted easier, and pour the molten smelted mixture into the cast to let it set and harden.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\tThe book is adorned with crude drawings of each process.<br><br>\n\t\n\t\"I have also found I can use limestone powder as the flux to refine ores and remove impurities in the smelting process.\"<br><br>\n\t\n\tThe bottom of the paged is signed with \"James Townsend, the Smithy\"."]

To skip/pass a turn, or to pick up item(s) on the tile you are standing on, press {Bindable.GameIdle} or use {Bindable.GameMoveDirection} with your mouse over your character. If you want to face a direction without moving, you can hold down {Bindable.GameFaceDirection} and your character will face towards your mouse. You can also use {Bindable.GameFaceUp}, {Bindable.GameFaceLeft}, {Bindable.GameFaceDown}, or {Bindable.GameFaceRight} to face up, left, down, or right, again, respectively.

To quickslot an item, use the action \"Add to Quickslot\", drag the item to a quickslot, or press any of the quickslot binds ({Bindable.GameQuickSlot1}, {Bindable.GameQuickSlot2}, etc).
